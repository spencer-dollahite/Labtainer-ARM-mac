# Running Labtainers on Apple Silicon Macs (M1/M2/M3/M4) using UTM

This guide explains how to set up and run **Labtainer**, a Linux-based cybersecurity lab environment, on an Apple Silicon Mac (M1, M2, M3 or M4) using **UTM**. Labtainer is typically not available for ARM, so this setup involves emulating an x86 environment. Thanks to this guide, NPS has officially provided a QCOW2 image, allowing users to skip several setup steps.

> **About this copy.** This guide was originally written by [CamilYed](https://github.com/CamilYed/Labtainer-ARM-mac) for a MacBook Pro M3. This fork carries corrections for the current UTM: choose **Emulate** (not Virtualize), leave **UEFI Boot** disabled, and set **Network Mode** to **Emulated VLAN**. Verified on an M2 (2026-09) with those exact settings; the Naval Postgraduate School's Labtainers page links here.

## Overview of Tools and File Formats

### What is an OVA file?
An **OVA** (Open Virtualization Archive) file is a standardized file format that packages all components of a virtual machine into a single file, making it easy to share and distribute VMs. OVA files can contain the VM disk image (usually in VMDK format), configuration files, and metadata.

### What is QCOW2?
**QCOW2** (QEMU Copy-On-Write version 2) is a disk image format used by QEMU. It supports advanced features such as snapshots, compression, and encryption, ideal for use in virtualized environments like UTM.

## Using the Official QCOW2 Image

### Step 1: Download the QCOW2 Image
NPS now provides an official QCOW2 image for Labtainer based on the original instructions in this guide. This image is pre-configured for use with UTM, allowing you to skip steps 2, 3, and 4 of the manual setup.

- [Official QCOW2 Image for Labtainer on Mac](https://nps.edu/web/c3o/virtual-machine-images)

### Step 2: Set Up the VM in UTM
After downloading the QCOW2 image:

1. **Unzip the file**.
2. **Download and install UTM**, if you haven’t already:
    - [UTM Download Link](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/releases/latest/download/UTM.dmg)
    - Install UTM by opening the `.dmg` file and dragging it to your Applications folder.
3. Open **UTM** and create a new virtual machine:
    - Click the **+** button in UTM and select **Emulate** to create a virtual machine.
    - Follow the wizard steps:
        - **System Settings**: Select the architecture and assign sufficient memory (e.g., 4GB or more).
        - Complete the wizard to create the VM. Do not worry about the disk settings during this step.
    - After the VM is created, open its configuration settings:
        - Add a new drive and select the **QCOW2** file as the drive source.
    - **Network**: set **Network Mode** to **Emulated VLAN** (see [Step 6](#step-6-configure-the-vm-settings) for why).
4. **Save and start the VM**. Refer to the [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/ckBRtSlhcww) if you need guidance.

## Preparing the Labtainer Image Manually

If you prefer a manual setup or for learning purposes, you can prepare the image yourself by following these steps.

### Step 1: Download UTM
UTM is a virtual machine manager for macOS that supports running VMs on both x86_64 and ARM-based Macs. Download the latest version of UTM for macOS from GitHub:

- [UTM Download Link](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/releases/latest/download/UTM.dmg)

After downloading, open the `.dmg` file and install UTM by dragging it to your Applications folder.

### Step 2: Download Labtainer OVA File
Labtainer is distributed as an OVA file. Download the pre-configured Labtainer OVA image for VMware:

- [Labtainer OVA Download Link](https://nps.box.com/shared/static/2582mm4x58mn6rqy049no0bspj5vdmqv.ova)

### Step 3: Install QEMU via Homebrew
To convert the OVA file to a QCOW2 format compatible with UTM, we’ll need **QEMU**, a free and open-source emulator. Install QEMU via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install qemu
```

> **Note**: Homebrew is a package manager for macOS. If you don’t have it installed, follow the instructions on [Homebrew’s website](https://brew.sh).

### Step 4: Convert OVA to QCOW2 Format
The OVA file is essentially a compressed archive. To extract it, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
tar -xvf LabtainerVM24a-VMWare.ova
```
![Extracting OVA file](images/unpacke-ova.png)

After extracting, you should see several files, including a `.vmdk` file (the virtual disk for VMware). We will convert this `.vmdk` file to the QCOW2 format:

```bash
qemu-img convert -O qcow2 LabtainerVM-VMWare-disk1.vmdk labtainer-utm-vm.qcow2
```

This command creates a file called `labtainer-utm-vm.qcow2`, which is compatible with UTM.

## Setting Up the Virtual Machine in UTM

### Step 5: Create a New Virtual Machine in UTM
1. Open **UTM** and click the **+** button to create a new virtual machine.
2. Select **Emulate** to create a virtual machine with x86_64 emulation.

### Step 6: Configure the VM Settings

On the original author's MacBook Pro M3 (36 GB RAM) the following configuration was used; the same settings were verified on an M2:

1. **System**:
    - **Architecture**: Set to **x86_64** (even though your Mac is ARM, UTM can emulate x86).
    - **CPU Cores**: Set to **4 cores**.
    - **Multithreading**: Enabled (recommended to improve performance).
    - **Boot Options**: Disable **UEFI Boot** (uncheck this option).

2. **Memory**: Allocate **8 GB of RAM** for the virtual machine. If you have less RAM, you may need to adjust this, but 8 GB is recommended for stable performance in Labtainers.

3. **Drive**: After creating the VM:
    - Open the VM’s configuration settings.
    - Add a new drive, select **Browse**, and attach the `labtainer-utm-vm.qcow2` file.

4. **Display**:
    - **Graphics Card**: Select **virtio-gpu-gl-pci (GPU Supported)** to enable better graphical performance.
    - **SPICE**: Ensure **SPICE** is selected if you need enhanced display options, such as clipboard sharing.

5. **Network**:
    - **Network Mode**: Set to **Emulated VLAN**.
    - Why: **Shared Network** relies on macOS's own DHCP service for the VM's IPv4 address, and that service often stops answering after the Mac sleeps, changes Wi-Fi networks, or connects to a VPN. The guest then shows only IPv6 addresses on `enp0s1` and reports `Network is unreachable`, so Labtainers cannot pull its Docker images. **Emulated VLAN** has QEMU provide NAT and DHCP inside the VM itself, with no dependency on the host, so the VM keeps its internet access. This is also the mode UTM recommends for emulated (non-native) guests.
    - If a VM you already created loses its network, shut it down, change this setting, and start it again.

### Step 7: Boot and Test the VM
1. Start the VM in UTM.
2. Once the VM boots, log in and check that Labtainers is operational.
